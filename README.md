This MQ Managed File Transfer (MQMFT) exit enables the user to control the order in which MQMFT transfers files. The user specifies instructions for sorting the files by their names, paths, sizes, or timestamps, thereby determining the transfer order; for example, a user might want MQMFT to move files in ascending order by size, with the smallest file arriving at the destination first and the biggest file last. Optionally, the user can also use a positioning capability to specify input files that should be transferred first or last, regardless of the sorting instructions; for example, a user might wish a summary file with an extension of “.sum” to arrive before accompanying files that contain the details.
